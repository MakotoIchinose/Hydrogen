Stay Hydrated!
---

**Stay Hydrated!** is an entry to Global Game Jam 2023. It is a top down 2.5D puzzle game about extraterrestrial fauna invading the Earth... just to look for a water source.

The objective of the game is to guide the root of the extraterrestrial plant to reach the elusive water and hydrate them to grow. The plants are rather picky, however, as they'll refuse to drink when they're still hydrated. You're also given a timer to challenge you to finish the levels as fast as possible. 

This project was made using a modified Unreal Engine 5.1 build, however, it does not use any lower level call, nor the modifications being necessary, therefore it should work in vanilla 5.1 build from the Epic Games Launcher.

This project has been developed in less than 48 hours, excluding rests. Some cuts have to be made to make time for the deadline.
